Dear publisher,

While processing your content we found your Qt Quick app's QML imports old, experimental components with "import Qt.labs.components.native 1.0 ".

This import is deprecated and your app will not run properly if newer Qt Quick components for Symbian 1.1 are installed on a customer's phone. Please use "import com.nokia.symbian 1.0" instead and rebuild your app.

You may refer to this Qt Developer wiki page for additional Qt 4.7.4 compatibility issues.
